## üîß Quick Compatibility Check

**Development Machine:**
```bash
# Check Python version
python3 --version  # Should be 3.11+

# Check Git
git --version

# Check SSH
ssh -V
```

**Windows Node:**
```powershell
# Check PowerShell version
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion  # Should be 5.1+

# Check available RAM
Get-ComputerInfo -Property TotalPhysicalMemory

# Check CPU cores
(Get-ComputerInfo).CsProcessors.NumberOfCores
```
